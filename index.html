        <p>You&#39;ve obviously made your way to this page because you&#39;re in search of Bible verses. You&#39;ll be happy to know that this entire website is devoted entirely to Bible verses with a large number of different generators containing Bible verses on numerous different topics the Bible discusses. If there&#39;s a topic you&#39;d like to know more about, we likely have a generator for verses that mention it so you can find exactly what the Bible says about it.</p>

<p>Using the generators on this website is simple and straightforward enough that even a child can use it. All you need to do is pick the number of Bible passages you&#39;d like to see each time and then click the button. You&#39;ll instantly see random Bible verses in the exact number you indicated. If you&#39;re more comfortable with a list of Bible verses, we have that for you too. Simple scroll to the bottom of the page and you&#39;ll see a list of 20 random Bible verses that change each time you refresh the page.</p>

<p><strong>Why&nbsp;Bible Verses?</strong></p>

<p>We sometimes get queries as to why we placed the verses in a generator and dispense them randomly rather than have a long list of the Bible verses for you to read through. We believe that random Bible verses can be one of the best ways to study the Bible, especially if you have become accustomed to studying it in a typical way. If you&#39;re not familiar with random generators, the below examples of how this Bible verse generator is typically used will give you some ideas to determine if using this free tool would be useful in your daily Bible study.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Bible Verse</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s no better way to begin each day than to do so with the word of God. One of the easiest and most convenient ways to do this is by reading a daily Bible verse. The Bible verse generator makes this even easier. With a click of a button, you have a random Bible verse before you to contemplate for the rest of the day. By putting your focus onto a single Bible verse of the day, you can spend quality time considering God&#39;s words and how they are important to your life.</p>

<p><strong>Discovering the Bible Again</strong></p>

<p>Most of us have Bible verses that we read time and again to gain strength and feel God&#39;s love. While this is an important part of any relationship with God, it often means we neglect large parts of the Bible as we concentrate on our favorites. By using a random Bible verse generator, you have the opportunity to rediscover other Bible passages you may have forgotten, and you&#39;ll likely discover new verses that will become favorites. It&#39;s a wonderful way to fall in love with the Bible all over again. God knows what you need to read in your life and random Bible verses are a way for that information to get to you.</p>

<p><strong>Improve Your Bible Knowledge</strong></p>

<p>Nothing brings you closer to God than expanding your knowledge of His word. Taking the time to generate random Bible verses and expanding your overall knowledge of what&#39;s in the Holy Book is a wonderful way to bring yourself closer to God. Getting random verses ensures that you truly know the ones that you have previously studied and learned, and the new ones will stand out so they will be easier to learn and remember. The more you learn the verses of the Bible, the closer you will find yourself to God.</p>

<p><strong>Stay Connected with God</strong></p>

<p>It would be great if we all had more time to study the Bible, but that&#39;s simply not possible for many people these days. There are numerous reasons that spending an hour or more each day reading the Holy Book just isn&#39;t feasible for some, but spending even a little time with God&#39;s words is better than nothing at all. Nobody can have a good excuse as to why they can&#39;t read a single Bible verse a day. Making this simple effort can help you stay connected with God even during the busiest times in your life.</p>

<p><strong>Sleeping on God&#39;s Words</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s not a better way to fall asleep than with the words of God running through your head as you doze off. A wonderful way to do this is to pick a single Bible verse to repeat over and over as you fall asleep, letting its meaning sink deep into your unconscious thoughts. You may even gain a better and unique understanding of the Bible passage as your mind continues to digest it&#39;s true meaning while you sleep. Sleeping on God&#39;s words is a wonderful way to discover new insights about Bible verses and what God wants you to learn from them.</p>

<p>These are only a few examples of how this random Bible verse generator can help you learn more about the Bible and thus get closer to God and His words. While it&#39;ll never replace reading directly from the Bible, it can be an excellent way to supplement your Bible reading. This is especially true since you get to choose the number of Bible passages you see with each click ensuring that you are able to consume the information in the exact amount you want each time. All of this can help you get closer to the Holy Book and God.</p>

<p>We hope you have found our Bible verse tool useful. We want this Bible Verse Generator to be the best possible. If you have any suggestions on how we can change it to make it more useful for you and your biblical studies, please take the time to send us a note telling us how. In addition, if there&#39;s a Bible topic that we don&#39;t have a dedicated generator for all the verses about that topic which you&#39;d like us to add, let us know and we&#39;ll do our best to create that tool for you.</p>

<p><strong>List of Bible Verses</strong></p>

<p><ol class="article_list" ><li> The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve thy soul.<br />
The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore.<br />
</li><li> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,<br />
Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br />
</li><li> As in water face<br />
answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.<br />
</li><li> (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)<br />
</li><li> And whatsoever ye do, do<br />
it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;<br />
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.<br />
</li><li> He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.<br />
</li><li> For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?<br />
</li><li> My flesh and my heart faileth:<br />
but God<br />
is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.<br />
</li><li> For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:<br />
Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.<br />
</li><li> For thou<br />
art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s sake lead me, and guide me.<br />
</li><li> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it<br />
are the issues of life.<br />
</li><li> Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.<br />
</li><li> And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br />
</li><li> To every<br />
thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:<br />
</li><li> And Jesus said unto them,<br />
I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.<br />
</li><li> Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.<br />
</li><li> He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life:<br />
but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.<br />
</li><li> In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it.<br />
</li><li> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.<br />
</li><li> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.<br />
</li><li> Follow peace with all<br />
men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:<br />
</li><li> I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.<br />
</li><li> He<br />
is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.<br />
</li><li> He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul:<br />
he that keepeth understanding shall find good.<br />
</li><li> Who<br />
is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.<br />
</li><li> For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.<br />
</li><li> Say not thou, What is<br />
the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.<br />
</li><li> Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring<br />
it to pass.<br />
And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.<br />
</li><li> Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day<br />
is the evil thereof.</li><li> Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.<br />
